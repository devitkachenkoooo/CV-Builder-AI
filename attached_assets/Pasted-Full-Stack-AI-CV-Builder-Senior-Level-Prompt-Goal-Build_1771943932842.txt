Full-Stack AI CV Builder: Senior Level Prompt
Goal: Build a production-ready SaaS application for generating resumes using AI.

1. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (animations), Lucide Icons.

Backend: FastAPI (Python), Authlib (Google OAuth2), Playwright (for A4 PDF rendering).

AI: Groq SDK (Model: Llama-3-70b/80b) with a provider-agnostic service (ready for OpenAI/Claude).

Database: Replit PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy.

Code Quality: ESLint for TS, Ruff for Python, strict typing.

2. Architecture & Pages:

Navigation: Modern sidebar or navbar with "Gallery" and "My Resumes".

Gallery Page (Home): - A responsive grid of template cards (using screenshots from /static/screenshots).

Hover Effect: On hover, a "Use Template" button appears with a smooth fade-in.

Action: Clicking "Use" opens a Modal.

Generation Modal:

Input for Google Docs URL.

"Generate" button.

Loading State: - While generating, show an A4-shaped Skeleton Loader.

Display step-by-step progress: "Fetching Document...", "AI Formatting...", "Generating PDF...".

Result View: - Once done, display the generated CV centered on the screen.

Floating Action Bar: A prominent "Download PDF" button and a "Print" button.

"My Resumes" Page:

A private gallery for the logged-in user.

Displays all previously generated CVs (stored in DB).

Each item has a preview, the date of creation, and a "Download" button.

3. Backend & AI Logic:

Auth: Google OAuth2 login is mandatory. Create a User and CVHistory table in the DB.

AI Injection:

Fetch text from Google Docs API.

Read the selected HTML/CSS template from /html-templates.

Prompt for Groq: "Analyze the provided raw CV text and inject it into the HTML template. Keep all <style> tags intact. Ensure the content fits perfectly on one A4 page. Return ONLY the final HTML code."

PDF Generation: Use Playwright to render the HTML in a headless browser (viewport A4: 794px x 1123px) and save it as a PDF buffer/file.

4. Visual Requirements (UX/UI):

Aesthetic: Clean, professional SaaS look (Glassmorphism elements, soft shadows, rounded corners).

Responsiveness: Perfect display on desktop and tablets.

Interactions: Use framer-motion for page transitions and modal pops.
