Please perform a technical optimization and UI/UX polish of the project. Focus on the following four areas:

1. Optimized Logout Flow:
Currently, the logout process feels jarring and triggers redundant reloads or premature redirects.

Task: Refactor the logout logic to ensure all application states and authentication tokens are fully cleared before redirecting to the landing page.

UX: If necessary, show a brief 'Logging out...' loading state to prevent the user from seeing a broken UI during the transition. Eliminate the 'double reload' glitch.

2. Mobile Responsiveness for File Selection Modal:
The modal used for file selection/upload is currently not responsive and breaks on smaller screens.

Task: Apply responsive design principles (Tailwind CSS or Media Queries) to the modal.

Requirements: On mobile devices, the modal should span approximately 90-95% of the screen width, include touch-friendly button sizes, and handle long content with internal scrolling instead of overflowing the viewport.

3. Global Application Responsiveness:
Review the entire application (Homepage, CV Editor, Dashboard) for mobile compatibility.

Task: Ensure the Navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile.

Layout: Audit all Flexbox and Grid layouts to ensure they wrap correctly. Eliminate any horizontal scrolling issues.

PDF Consistency: Ensure that these responsive changes do not affect the html2pdf.js generation logic (the hidden/overlay render container must maintain its fixed width for A4 consistency).

4. Code Audit and Self-Correction:

Task: Check the browser console and server logs for any recurring Errors or Warnings and fix them.

Optimization: Identify and remove any redundant re-renders in React components. Clean up any 'ghost' elements left in the DOM from previous PDF generation attempts.

Stability: Verify that all Protected Routes are functioning correctly and that the app doesn't crash if a user manually refreshes the page while logged in.

Please provide a brief summary of the changes made for each point once finished.
